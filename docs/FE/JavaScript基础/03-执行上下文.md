### 作用域
> Like most modern programming languages, JavaScript uses lexical scoping. This means that functions are executed using the variable scope that was in effect when they were defined, not the variable scope that is in effect when they are invoked.
- **JavaScript采用的是词法作用域，函数的作用域基于函数创建的位置。**
### 可执行代码
全局代码、函数代码、eval代码
